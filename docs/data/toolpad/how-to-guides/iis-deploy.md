<p class="description">You can host and share your Toolpad apps on IIS in a few minutes.</p>

## Prerequisites

- A [IIS](https://www.iis.net/) installation
- An [iisnode](https://github.com/Azure/iisnode) installation

You can host Toolpad applications on iisnode, just like you can host any Node.js application IIS. You can use the custom server feature of Toolpad to host [Toolpad in a express.js server](/toolpad/concepts/custom-server/), which in turn [you can host on iisnode](https://tomasz.janczuk.org/2011/08/hosting-express-nodejs-applications-in.html).
