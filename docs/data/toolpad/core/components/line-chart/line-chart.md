# Line Chart

<p class="description">Line Chart component for Toolpad Core applications.</p>

Toolpad Core extends X Charts with data provider support. Toolpad Core charts automatically load data and adopt defaults for labels and formatting.

## Basic example

Add a data provider to a chart and its data is automatically loaded in the chart.

{{"demo": "BasicLineChart.js"}}

Error and loading states are automatically handled. Errors from the data provider are shown in an overlay:

{{"demo": "ErrorLineChart.js", "hideToolbar": true}}
